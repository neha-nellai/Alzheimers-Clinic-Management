# Alzheimers-Clinic-Management

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. While there is no known cure for it, the progression of the disease can be slowed by early detection of the disease. Further efficient management of clinics dedicated to Alzheimerâ€™s patients may help reduce the woes of the patients and their family. It is important to integrate neurological disorder classifiers with existing clinic management systems to deal with this global health crisis.
